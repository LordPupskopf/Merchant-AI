The Merchant AI by Lord Pupskopf.
This AI was made for the 3rd Ascension AI Turnament and is only meant for it.
This AI was solely made for fun and the joy of creating and is by no means ment to be taken seriously or expected to win.
Whilst this AI was made with no foreign help, my expertise in AI creation has been fueled by the cunning of people like Nevikov/ HeroesFlorian and Monsterfish and with this I want to say my thanks.
No the AIV of the AI is not using any exploits, however it is using the reliable dummy steps I found using cheatengine. These steps do not appear in any kind within the game, nor do they interfere with other AIs.
